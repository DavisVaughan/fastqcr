Description: 'FASTQC' is the most widely used sequence quality assessment tool 
    for evaluating the raw reads in fastq files from high throughput sequencing data.  
    It produces, for each sample, an html report and a 'zip' file containing the raw data. 
    If you have hundreds of samples, youâ€™re not going to open up each HTML page. 
    You need some way of looking at these data in aggregate. 
    'fastqcr' Provides helper functions to easily parse, aggregate and analyze 
    'FastQC' reports for large numbers of samples. It provides a convenient solution for building 
    a 'multi-QC' report, as well as, a 'one-sample' report with result interpretations.
